    I am Esther from Hong Kong. <br/><br/>

    This is my second last semester here. I am blessed to study in Math and Computer Science in BYUH! 
    Although I haven't meet you in person, but I hope to get to know each of you more this semester :)<br/><br/>

     Here is a list of links of website I often visit.
